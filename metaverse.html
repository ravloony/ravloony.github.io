      <h2>We just need to finish building it</h2>
      <p>
        One of the foundational principles of Web 1.0 is the hyperlink.This
        deceptively simple device allows to reference any arbitrary page on any
        arbitrary website. The power of this cannot be underestimated, and
        certainly in the last 25-odd years the exponential expansion of the web
        has been made possible by it.
      </p>
      <p>
        One thing that is very interesting about the hyperlink is the property
        that it has of suppressing the concept of distance. A web page author
        can link to any other (public) page on the internet, with no
        restrictions, and more importantly, instant access to that page. This
        means it is possible to navigate through the information (or
        entertainment) on the internet with (essentially) no waiting time. To
        get from one place to another, there is no need to get in a car, bus or
        plane and physically change location.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now it would conceivably be possible to replicate this in part by having
        a large collection of texts that reference each other. This is why
        libraries exist: it has long been true that it is more economically
        viable to copy a book (even before the invention of the printing press!)
        rather than travel each time you want to read it. But with the advent of
        the hyperlink, that fact has now been reversed: it is more economically
        viable to go to the “book”, as distance is now suppressed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, this is not literally the case, it is just the experience
        that one has using a web browser. The point is simply that the copy of
        the information does not need to be accessed until the precise point in
        time when you wish to obtain it. In effect, it is exactly as if you
        could travel instantly to the library where the page you wish to read is
        located, read it, then leave again.
      </p>
      <p>So how does this relate to the metaverse?</p>
      <p>
        Web pages are no longer static, and have not been for a long time. If
        you consider a social network, or a web app, there are many forms of
        dynamic web page, some of which have a social component. These pages
        make it feel like you are present, in some manner. One speaks of being
        “on” Twitter, or Discord.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a side-note, not all web apps have this property. One is not “on”,
        say Jira, or Turbotax, rather one “uses” these apps, just like
        traditional software.
      </p>
      <p>
        The metaverse is composed of these social apps, where one can “be”, and
        between which one can instantly move.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, the experience is still lacking a lot. The social dimension is
        still severely limited. It is possible to be aware that other people are
        using the platform at the same time, but their presence is limited to
        status indicators, essentially. This is where 3d technology shines. It
        is possible today to build environments which allow a netizen to freely
        move around, have experiences, and interact with others. So it stands to
        reason that 3d spaces should be common by now for the social web. And in
        fact, companies as large as Meta are already making billion-dollar bets
        in this direction. But it does not yet seem to be the case. Most
        metaverse applications are dead zones, with the odd curious user moping
        around trying to look as if they meant to be there. Why is this, and how
        can we fix it?
      </p>
      <p>
        Part of the solution in our view is the hyperlink. Once it is possible
        to link to a specific place in a specific metaverse application, then
        whatever experience is to be found there will automatically be available
        to anyone in hyperspace. This in turn means it will be possible to drive
        traffic to specific hyperplaces at specific times.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is a second problem however, which is portability. Let&apos;s
        imagine that it is possible to link to a specific place in a 3d
        environment, maybe an event in the metaverse, or a building. If you
        click on that link, your browser will load the 3d environment, but it
        does not know which settings to apply. Which avatar should you use?
        Which interface language?
      </p>
      <p>
        Now traditionally, websites have implemented solutions to this kind of
        problem using cookies and site-specific settings, usually saved by the
        website itself. But as the complexity grows, both in the type of
        user-specific data (avatar), and in the possible interactions between
        participants (voice, video, transactions), this model becomes
        unscalable.
      </p>
      <p>Two examples come to mind immediately.</p>
      <p>
        The first is the user&apos;s avatar. This should be customisable, which
        takes time. When a user arrives in a new environment, they do not want
        to have to spend time setting this up.
      </p>
      <p>
        Secondly, person-to-person communication sometimes involves private
        data, which the platform should not have to save somewhere. This is
        obviously even more important in transactions: users may wish to send
        money to each other. This should be enabled without the environment ever
        having access to the money.
      </p>
      <p>
        A blockchain based identity solves these problems. Identity, financial
        secret information, and even avatar preferences (assuming the presence
        of at least a common standard) can be transmitted from a web wallet
        without leaking any private information to the 3d platform. It would be
        trivial to implement token sending from avatar to avatar using something
        like Metamask for example.
      </p>
      <p>
        So there we have it. The metaverse, understood as the virtual hyperspace
        created by the existence of the hyperlink, and inhabited by virtual
        avatars whose unique identity is founded in the blockchain consensus,
        exists already. It is currently known as Web 3.0, but that is just a
        current nametag. It has been coming into existence since the invention
        of the hyperlink.
      </p>
      <p>
        At Eldora, we are in the process of making this hyperspace socially
        navigable.
